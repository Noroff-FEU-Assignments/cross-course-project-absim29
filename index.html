    <h2>Web Security</h2>
    <p id="web-security-question">How would you advise a potential client to secure his/her website from web security attacks? Note: the word count for your answer should not be greater than 250 words</p>
    <p id="web-security-answer">First thing I would advise is to start with research on security risks. It is important to have a plan in case of malicious attack. 
        Using a secure server and HTTPS protocol allows for secure communication by encrypting the data and prevents intruders from accessing your information. I would suggest an efficient password management that includes using strong passwords and two-factor authentication, as well as an automatic user timeout. It is also useful to use vulnerability scanning tools and perform security tests regularly. Remember to review the written code and have a data backup available.
